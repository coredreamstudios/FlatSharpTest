Trying to learn FlatSharp and tried to do it on my own with James Courtney's example for a custom fbs but never got it to work.

So tried the extact fbs and classes Jame made and still nothing. Uploaded here for him or anyone if they can tell me what went wrong.

Monster is no where to be found.

```csharp
Monster monster = new Monster(){
...
}
```
